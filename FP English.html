The Flipped classroom procedure could be divided into three part including pre-class learning preparation, in-class learning activities, and post-class learning consolidation (Kong, 2014). Meanwhile, this procedure can be coupled with Anderson and Krathwohl ‘s revised taxonomy (2009), which puts language learning into two dimensions: knowledge and cognitive process. The knowledge dimension includes factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge and the cognitive process dimension reflects thinking skills such as remembering, understanding, applying, evaluating, and creating.";

      <h5>An English course with Flipped Classroom</h5>
      <p>This ideal Flipped Language Lab is combined with a pedagogical framework for mobile assisted language teaching and learning. That is, since the Flipped classroom depends more on self-learning and technology support, much research will be conducted to combine this pedagogical framework to design the lab. </p>
