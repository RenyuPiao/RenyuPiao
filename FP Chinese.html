In addition to the usual challenges that come with learning any language from scratch, people studying Mandarin must also memorize thousands of special characters, unlike anything seen in Latin-based languages.But writing isn’t the only difficult part of learning Mandarin. The tonal nature of the language makes speaking it very hard as well. There are several Chinese dialects, including Cantonese — spoken primarily in southeastern China, as well as in Hong Kong and other parts of Southeast Asia — which have different written characters and pronunciations, and are also very difficult to learn. Mandarin Chinese (the most common dialect) has four tones, so one word can be pronounced four different ways, and each pronunciation has a different meaning. For instance, the word ma can mean “mother,” “horse,” “rough” or “scold” — depending on how you say it.";

      <h2>Course Feature</h2>
      <p>-Our course usually starts with story time or meaningful material display. Each week the teacher will choose an interesting topic, highlighting comprehensive ability and useful knowledge learning.</p>
      <p>-The second part emphasizes on reading practice. Each student will read aloud during this session. The reading material is meaningful and suitable to elementary level. Questions are asked before, during, and after the read aloud session to encourage reading comprehensive.</p>
      <p>-In the last part we will have more comprehensive training. One example is roll and play. Each student will select a role and act out the activity shown. Another example is to retell the material content. These interesting activities is beneficial to student’s comprehensive language skills especially the reading skill.</p>
